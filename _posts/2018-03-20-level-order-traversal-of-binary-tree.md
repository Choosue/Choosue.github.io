### How to summarize this question in one sentenceï¼Ÿ

Using BFS (Breadth-First Search) to traverse the binary tree in level order.

### What algorithm(s) and data structure(s) are involved?

- Algorithm: BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Data structure: Queue

For example, as the binary tree showed in the graph below:

![level order traversal]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/algorithm/level_order.png

The level order traversal of this binary tree should be:

```
[20],
[9, 49],
[5, 12, 23, 52],
[15, 50]
```
